              <small>Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You'll burn about 400
              calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including
              your legs, hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that's gentle
              on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice. You
              can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail.</small>
